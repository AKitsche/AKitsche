I earned a PhD at the Institute of Biostatistics at the Leibniz University of Hannover. During my studies I started learning R and wrote some small packages stored on my GitHub page. This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets.\nIn addition I propagate and cultivate Bonsai trees for several years. Within this blog I want to document the development of some of my favorite trees."
