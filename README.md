### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have a Masters degree in Plant Biotechnology with focus on Biostatistics. I earned a PhD at the Institute of Biostatistics at the Leibniz University of Hannover. During my studies I started learning R and wrote some small packages stored on my GitHub page. 

This [blog](https://akitsche.netlify.app/) will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets.

In addition I propagate and cultivate Bonsai trees for several years. Within this blog I want to document the developement of some of my favourite trees.
